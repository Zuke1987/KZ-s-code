            <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
            <img src="images/Aboutme2.jpg" alt="Portrait of Kevin Zuhoski" />
            <p>I have some experience with programming in Java and Python through
    coursework taken at the university.  I have also taken some other computer
    science courses such as a course in discrete math.  In addition, I have read
    a few books on the Java language, HTML, and CSS as well as completed some
    tutorials in Python, and MySQL. Nevertheless, I still consider my self a
    beginner when it comes to software and web development.  My background is in
    two fields that are seemingly unrelated to the development world but both
    have given me skills that would make me a successful developer.</p>
    <p>I graduated in 2005 with a degree in Linguistics and a TESOL teaching
      certificate, and recently graduated in May of this year with a degree in
    Nursing.  Both degrees and subsequent jobs that I have been employed in have
    given me people skills, critical thinking skills, the ability to problem
    solve, as well as various other skills which are applicable to a developer.
    Aside from my academic background, I also possess character traits that would
    make me a successful developer.  I am a self-learner, persistent,
    competitive, hard-working, analytical, logical, and I have an innate drive
    to succeed as well as laser focus when there is something I want to accomplish.
