      <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
      <p>I have some experience with programming in Java and Python through
      coursework taken at the university.  I have also taken some other computer
    science courses such as a course in discrete math.  In addition, I have read
    a few books on the Java language, HTML, and CSS as well as completed some
    tutorials in Python, and MySQL. Nevertheless, I still consider my self a
    beginner when it comes to software and web development.  My background is in
    two fields that are seemingly unrelated to the development world but both
    have given me skills that would make me a successful developer.</p>
      <p>I graduated in 2005 with a degree in Linguistics and a TESOL teaching
      certificate, and recently graduated in May of this year with a degree in
    Nursing.  Both degrees and subsequent jobs that I have been employed in have
    given me people skills, critical thinking skills, the ability to problem
    solve, as well as various other skills which are applicable to a developer.
    Aside from academic background I also possess character traits that would
    make me a successful developer.  I am a self-learner, persistent,
    competitive, hard-working, analytical, logical, and I have an innate drive
    to succeed and laser focus when there is something I want to accomplish.
  </p>

      <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
      <p>There are many accomplishments that I am proud of but a few that
      really stand out and that required a high degree of consistency and
    commitment to accomplish. One accomplishment I am extremely proud of is
  having moved to Japan and having lived and worked there.  This required me
to face my fear of the unknown and to survive and thrive in a foreign country
that has a vastly different culture and language relative to the western world.
Every day was a challenge and I constantly had to adapt in order to acclimate
myself to a new world.  Instead of quitting and going home I stayed there
 for over three years and was able to thrive.  While there, I also achieved
one of my long time goals.  I was able to pass the second highest Japanese
proficiency test.  This required me to be consistent in my study of Japanese
over the course of three years, and I spent countless hours studying to pass
this exam.  Having taken it three times before passing, I also demonstrated
my relentess "never quit" attitude in order to pass.</p>
      <p>One other accomplishment I am especially proud of is graduating from
      nursing school.  This required an unwavering level of commitment to
    study daily for hours and hours and to never quit despite some "failures."
  It pushed me beyond my comfort level both physically and emotionally
and allowed me to grow as an individual.  I was able to get a 4.0 in the
prerequisite classes usually required for medical school, which I once feared
and considered to be extremely difficult.  I demonstrated to myself that I can
accomplish anything I put my mind to and it gave me the confidence to pursue
any future so called "impossible" endeavors.</p>

      <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
      <p>I have several hobbies but if I had to mention just few I would say
      my favorites are studying foreign languages, and playing instruments like the
    guitar and piano. As for studying languages, it gives
  me great satisfaction learning new words and ways of expressing ideas in a new
language, and communicating with others who have such a different perspective
on life.  I also enjoy trying to discern the patterns in language so that I can
express myself effectively.
</p>
<p>I also enjoy playing the guitar and piano.  It allows me a creative outlet
to express what cannot be conveyed in words.  I also feel a great sense of
accomplishment when I finish learning an entire song.  It is just an amazing
experience to connect with something that is deep within yourself but also
something separate from yourself.</p>
