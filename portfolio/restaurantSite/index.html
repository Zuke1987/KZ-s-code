            Restaurant Description<br />
            This restaurant was founded in 2018 by cousins Brian and Kevin
            Zuhoski with the hopes of sharing classic American cuisine with the
            residents of Long Island, NY. Our restaurant features a full bar
            with some of the nation's highest ranked ales and lagers and a
            variety of beers from Long Island's local breweries. Our menu offers
            American classics such as hot dogs and burgers, Texas style Brisket,
            and several other dishes which will satisfy the palette of any diner.
            Along with exquisite cuisine another highlight of our restaurant are
            our wall to wall flat screen TV's which are always showing the latest
            and most exciting sporting events.  Come on down and enjoy some
            mouth-watering food, premium beer, and the sports arena like ambience
            of our restaurant.
